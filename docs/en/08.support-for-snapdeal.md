# SnapDeal Support

## SnapDeal Overview
`SnapDeal` is a sector upgrade proposal introduced in [FIP-19](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0019.md) and merged in `nv15`. Compared to previous upgrade proposals that required a complete re-seal process, SnapDeal is relatively lightweight. Its cost is approximately:
- Completing an `add piece` task
- Completing a `tree d` task
- Completing a `snap_encode` task, which costs about the same as a `pc2` task
- Completing a `snap_prove` task, which costs about the same as a `c1` + `c2` task

Therefore, SnapDeal is attractive for both first-time data onboarding and upgrading of existing `CC sectors`.

## Damocles SnapDeal Support
`Damocles` is designed to provide a way to mass produce storage power. For this purpose, we have introduced a SnapDeal production scheme that requires minimal human intervention, which we call `SnapUp`. The steps involved are as follows:

1. Import existing `CC sectors` in batches as candidate sectors.
2. Configure `damocles-manager` to enable `SnapUp` mode for specified `SPs`.
3. Configure `sealing_thread` of `damocles-worker` to `SnapUp` production plans or add new `sealing_thread` for `SnapUp`.

Throughout this process, users only need to focus on importing new candidate sectors and monitoring the remaining of candidate sectors, as all other processes will be automated.

## Example
Let's use an example of a production cluster on the `butterfly` network to demonstrate how to configure the SnapUp production scheme.

### Importing Candidate Sectors
Using the newly added `util sealer snap fetch` tool, you can import `CC sectors` that meet the `SnapUp` condition (remaining lifetime greater than 180 days and satisfying the minimum lifetime requirement for storage deals) as candidate sectors per their deadlines.
```
./dist/bin/damocles-manager util sealer snap fetch 1153 3
2022-04-15T04:28:03.380Z        DEBUG   policy  policy/const.go:18      NETWORK SETUP   {"name": "butterfly"}
2022-04-15T04:28:03.401Z        INFO    cmd     internal/util_sealer_snap.go:53 candidate sectors fetched        {"available-in-deadline": 2, "added": 2}
```

### Monitoring Remaining Candidate Sector
```
./dist/bin/damocles-manager util sealer snap candidates 1153
2022-04-15T04:28:13.955Z        DEBUG   policy  policy/const.go:18      NETWORK SETUP   {"name": "butterfly"}
deadline  count
3         2
```
As seen, there are currently 2 `CC sectors` available in the `#3 deadline` as candidates for upgrade.

### Configuring damocles-worker
In `damocles-worker`, the main configurations required are related to `SnapUp` job, such as `sealing_thread`s, and resource allocation for `snap_encode` and `snap_prove` tasks.

Here is an example configuration:
```toml
[[sealing_thread]]
location = "/data/local-snap-1"
plan = "snapup"

[[sealing_thread]]
location = "/data/local-snap-2"
plan = "snapup"

[[sealing_thread]]
location = "/data/local-snap-3"
plan = "snapup"

[[sealing_thread]]
location = "/data/local-snap-4"
plan = "snapup"

[[sealing_thread]]
location = "/data/local-snap-5"
plan = "snapup"

[[sealing_thread]]
location = "/data/local-snap-6"
plan = "snapup"

[[sealing_thread]]
location = "/data/local-snap-6"
plan = "snapup"

[processors.limitation.concurrent]
# ...
tree_d = 1
snap_encode = 5
snap_prove = 2

[[processors.snap_encode]]
envs = { FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_COLUMN_BUILDER = "1", FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_TREE_BUILDER = "1", CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "0", TMPDIR="/var/tmp/worker0" }

[[processors.snap_prove]]
envs = { CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "0" , TMPDIR="/var/tmp/worker0" }

[[processors.snap_encode]]
envs = { FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_COLUMN_BUILDER = "1", FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_TREE_BUILDER = "1", CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "0", TMPDIR="/var/tmp/worker1" }

[[processors.snap_prove]]
envs = { CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "1", TMPDIR="/var/tmp/worker1" }
```

The resource allocation for `snap_encode` can be similar to `pc2`, and for `snap_prove`, it can be similar to `c2`.

### Configuring damocles-manager
In `damocles-manager`, the required configuration mainly involves enabling `SnapUp` for specific `SPs`. Here is an example:

```
[[Miners]]
Actor = 1153
[Miners.Sector]
InitNumber = 0
MaxNumber = 10000
Enabled = true
EnableDeals = false

[Miners.SnapUp]
Enabled = true
Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"
```

In this configuration:
- The settings in `[Miners.Sector]` do notSpecify the complete configuration details for the SnapUp production scheme. However, the key points to note are:
- Set `Enabled = true` to enable SnapUp for the specified `SP`.
- Under this example configuration, you would get...
  - continuous production of `CC` Sector 
  - SnapUp continues production while there are available candidate sectors

### Tips
- Considering the computing resources required by `snap_encode` and `snap_prove`, if you enable regular sector sealing and `SnapUp` at the same time in the same `damocles-worker` instance, you may encounter race condition of hardware resource. You can refer to 07.damocles-worker external executor configuration example (En doc to be updated).

- Considering the deployment of sector persistent storage, the `damocles-worker` used for `SnapUp` needs to be able to have both read and write access to all persistent storage spaces (persist stores), and ensure that their names are consistent with those defined in `damocles-manager`.
- Based on the above two points, we recommend using a separate box specifically for `SnapUp` production to avoid the configuration, operation and maintenance complexity caused by mixing regular sectors and `SnapUp` sealing.

## Continuous Improvement
The improvement and optimization of the `SnapUp` solution are still in progress. Currently we are mainly focusing on:

- Convert semi-automatic candidate sector import to automatic mode, or provide equivalent operation and maintenance tools
- More candidate sector import rules, such as import by storage configuration
- Aggregation of on-chain messages to reduce costs
- Other optimizations and tooling that can simplify operation & maintenance, reduce costs, and improve efficiency
