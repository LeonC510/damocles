# Quick start

## Preparation:

1. Install the necessary third-party libraries. 
   
   This part can refer to the corresponding [software dependencies section](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/install/linux/#software-dependencies) in `lotus` documentation.

2. Install code library.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles.git
    ```

3. Compile components of `damocles`

    ```
    cd damocles
    make all
    ```

    After building, there will be two executable files `damocles-worker` and `damocles-manager` under the `./dist/bin` directory.

4. Distribute the executable files to the machines where they are needed.

5. Distribute `./damocles-worker/create-cgroup.sh` to the machines where `damocles-worker `will run, and execute it as the system user that will run `damocles-worker`.

    This will create the corresponding `cgroup` for that user, so that `damocles-worker` can allocate hardware resources for its external worker processes.

## Production mode

### Domocles-manager

1. Initialized work directory.

    ```
    ./dist/bin/damocles-manager daemon init
    ```

2. Configure the default config file `~/.damocles-manager/sector-manager.cfg` as needed. 
   
   The config items, functionalities, and configuration methods can refer to the documentation [Configuration of damocles-manager](./04.damocles-manager-config.md).

3. Create the miner ID (optional, if you already have one, please skip)

    ```bash
    $ ./damocles-manager util miner create \
    --from=<OWNER_ADDRESS> \
    --owner=<OWNER_ADDRESS> \
    --worker=<WORKER_ADDRESS> \
    --sector-size=32GiB
    ```

    You will get the following return value.

    ```
    miner actor: f0xxx9 (f2drcv6746m5ehwxxxxxy)	   
    ```

    the ` miner actor: f0xxx9`is the miner id just created.


    > Attention: --The from address must have sufficient balance to ensure successful on-chaining.


4. Start `damocles-manager`

    ```bash
    ./dist/bin/damocles-manager daemon run
    ```

    > Attention: If you want to enable winningPost, both the `Miners.Proof. Enabled` field in the config file and the` --miner `flag when starting need to be set to true. Similarly, to enable windowPost, `Miners.PoSt.Enabled` in the config file and the `--poster` flag when starting need to be set to true together.

### Domocles-worker

1. Create the parent directory of `sealing_thread.location`, `damocles-worker` will automatically initialize each `sealing_thread.location` directory on startup.

2. (Optional) Download the compute parameter files.

    ```bash
    ./dist/bin/damocles-manager util fetch-params 512MiB
    ```

3. (Optional) Create (./15.damocles-worker_PC1_HugeTLB_Pages_支持.md#damocles-worker-pc1-hugetlb-pages-%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81).

4. Plan the CPU cores, numa zones etc configuration for each stage.

    Complete the configuration file as needed.

    Configuration items, functions, and configuration methods can be found in the documentation [Configurations of damocles-worker](./03.damocles-worker-config.md).

5. Start damocles-worker.

    ```
    ./dist/bin/damocles-worker daemon -c /path/to/damocles-worker.toml
    ```


## Mock mode(for developers)

By default, you can start a set of `mock` instances on a single machine through a series of commands.

### Domocles-manager

Using the command:

```
./dist/bin/damocles-manager mock --miner=10000 --sector-size=2KiB
```

To start a `damocles-manager` service simulating an `SP` with `Actor` `t010000` allocated `2KiB` sectors.

This step can also be accomplished by running the `./mock/start_manager.sh` script in the code directory.

### Domocles-worker

1. Create and initialize local storage, initialize remote storage.

   ```
   ./dist/bin/damocles-worker store sealing-init -l ./mock-tmp/store1 ./mock-tmp/store2 ./mock-tmp/store3
   ./dist/bin/damocles-worker store file-init -l ./mock-tmp/remote
   ```

    This step can also be accomplished by running the `./mock/cleanup_store.sh` script in the code directory.

2. Start `damocles-worker` with mock configuration.

    ```
    ./dist/bin/damocles-worker daemon -c ./damocles-worker/assets/damocles-worker.mock.toml
    ```

    This step can also be accomplished by running the `./mock/start_worker.sh` script in the code directory.
